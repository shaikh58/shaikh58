<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Mustafa! Welcome to my Github page</h1>
<h4 align="center">I'm currently a graduate student (M.S.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego with a focus on Machine Learning and Robotics </h4>
  
My research focus is on a trajectory optimization problem with a limited field of view formulation in a hide-and-seek game scenario. Previously, I have worked in industry for ~5 years in large organizations in a data science role. I completed my undergraduate studies in engineering at the University of Toronto.
